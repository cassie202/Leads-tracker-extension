# Leads Tracker Extension 

## Leads Tracker Extension 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a lead tracker extension that can be used to gather individual profile links by copying and pasting the link in the extension's input field, and clicking save Input which saves permanently in the extension. The User can also delete the input. Users can save current tab directly without copying and pasting by clicking the save tab button. The links are stored permanently in the extension and can be retrieved at any time.
